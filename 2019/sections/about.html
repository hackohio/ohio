<h1>What is HackOHI/O?</h1>

<p>
    HackOHI/O is a 24 hour hackathon that attracts over 750 participants annually for a full weekend of coding, building, learning, networking, and innovation.
    HackOHI/O gives students a unique opportunity to jumpstart a project in an environment that's all about supporting them.
</p>

<p>
    Teams will come up with an idea themselves or can be inspired by challenges presented by our supporting companies and organizations.
    After the 24 hours are over, teams present their project to judges to compete for prizes and could possibly win funding and further opportunities to continue their project!
</p>

<p>
    HackOHI/O is put on by a student-run organization called OHI/O. We are a small but mighty team of students that plan and organize sponsorship, logistics, branding, marketing and website of HackOHI/O.
    OHI/O is dedicated to creating opportunities for students to use their skills to create impactful and innovative projects.

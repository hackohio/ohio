            What can we build with Azure Cognitive Services? Anything and everything!
            We encourage you to think about how AI can address a user problem.
            For example, how can you use AI to improve student life or day to day productivity?

            Demonstrate how batteries can benefit customers and the environment.
            Specifically, using records of historical energy consumption, approximate cost structure, and details of different battery systems, identify customers who are the best candidates for installing a battery system and build a business case to show them the benefits.
            Additionally, investigate how such battery systems can reduce the impact on the environment without reducing total energy consumption.
            As a bonus challenge, recommend changes to the cost structure that would incentivize increased battery deployments.

            Create a concept to display data in either a mobile application (e.g. on a forklift or mobile device) or a web application that provides enhanced safety, increased productivity, and/or improves autonomous operations.
            A pre-populated data set will be available via REST APIs hosted in a cloud environment, however, a custom data set may be used. Potential users can be forklift operators, warehouse supervisors, or pedestrians working around autonomous forklifts.
